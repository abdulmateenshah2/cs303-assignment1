- Remove a number at a given index
- Display the array

Try-catch blocks are used for the modify and add functions as required.

Challenges Faced

There werent many challenges I faced in this assignment, only challenge was making sure the remove function correctly shifts elements without
  losing data or causing index errors. Another challenge was bugs but co-pilot helped me in those.
